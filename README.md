# Autism AI 

## Brief Introduction
Autism AI is a software system developed by Reza Shahamiri, the client and product owner (referred to from here on as PO), that employs deep learning algorithms to detect and diagnose autistic patterns. Currently, the AI is only accessible through an Android app. This significantly limits the number of users who can access the AI.


### Requirments 

The application was designed to be run on [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) 2019 and above. The application also requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) for the additional libraries used in the React project. Additionally, the repository has standards for commit messages and pull requests. For more information on the git workflow please have a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/WaiHaiDere/AutismAI-WEB/wiki).


### Running The Project 

The steps for running the project should be as follows:
1. Pull the development branch from GitHub
2. Create a new branch for your changes
3. Open the project in Visual Studio
4. Open the terminal in Visual Studio
5. Run "npm i" in the terminal 
6. Run "npm run dev" which should build the project
7. In the top left-hand corner of Visual Studio run the project via the play button
8. Once you've made your changes create a pull request for that branch into the dev branch
