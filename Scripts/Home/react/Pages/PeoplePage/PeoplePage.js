                    Reza is the scientific lead for this project is a Senior Lecturer in Software
                    Engineering at The University of Auckland. He has a high level of interest in
                    this project as it directly relates to his research in Artificial Intelligence
                    (AI) for healthcare diagnosis. Reza’s primary desire for this project is to
                    gather more data points to train his diagnosis AI. He wants this to be achieved
                    by expanding the AutismAI platform to reach more users for surveying.
